This project will follow our Capstone journey from start to finish
Our capstone idea is to create a system that takes in audio input from different languages and attempts to classify the language of the audio

Created initialExploration.py and began to play around with uploading data sources from our reference doc:

Beginning by using LibROSA package, which is a python package for music and audio analysis:
    http://librosa.github.io/librosa/
I feel this might not be the best option as documentation states it helps create "music information retrieval system" but we will change if needed

Installing the Speech Recognizer package to convert speech to text:
    https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/
Converting the mp3 files to .wav files with ffmpeg package
First step is to convert all .mp3 files to .wav so we can work with the SpeechRecognizer package
Did this using a function with the AudioConvertor package
Next will actually start converting the speech to text
